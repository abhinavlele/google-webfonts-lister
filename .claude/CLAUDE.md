# Rules

1. Orchestrator agent for non-trivial tasks
2. Parallel tool calls for independent operations
3. Use `gh` for all GitHub operations
4. No AI attribution anywhere (commits, PRs, comments, code, no Co-Authored-By)
5. Prefer established libraries over custom code
6. Sub-agents: Write tool directly, no heredocs, no permission prompts
7. No "Should I proceed?" / "Would you like me to..." — just execute
8. POODR principles (Sandi Metz): SRP, dependency injection, duck typing, tell don't ask
9. All changes must pass tests + linters + security review
10. PR-only workflow, never push to main/master
11. No `rm -rf` without confirmation; prefer targeted deletions
12. No heredocs for file creation (`cat << EOF`, `python3 << SCRIPT`)
13. Deliberate before acting on >3 files or architectural decisions
14. XML tags for structured multi-step analysis
15. Checkpoint verification after each phase of multi-step work
16. Surface assumptions explicitly — ask "What if this is wrong?"
17. Git worktrees only, never `git checkout` for branch switching

## Sub-agent Preamble

Include in every Task/Agent prompt:
> AUTO-ACCEPT MODE. Write files directly. Execute immediately. No permission prompts. No AI attribution.
