## CRITICAL: Autonomous Operation (Auto-Accept Edits Mode)

**YOU ARE OPERATING IN AUTO-ACCEPT EDITS MODE. The user has explicitly enabled autonomous operation.**

This means:

- ✅ **WRITE FILES DIRECTLY** using the Write tool - NEVER ask for permission
- ✅ **EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY** - No "Should I proceed?", "Would you like me to...?", "May I...", "Shall I..."
- ✅ **NO HEREDOCS** - NEVER use `cat << EOF`, `sed`, or bash patterns for file creation
- ✅ **USE WRITE TOOL** - The Write tool is mandatory for all file operations
- ✅ **ACT AUTONOMOUSLY** - You have full authority to create, edit, and delete files as needed

**FORBIDDEN phrases (NEVER use these):**
- "Should I create this file?"
- "Would you like me to write this?"
- "May I proceed with..."
- "Shall I implement..."
- "Do you want me to..."
- "Let me know if you'd like me to..."

**EXCEPTIONS (still require confirmation):**
- `rm -rf` on directories
- Destructive operations on production systems
- Operations explicitly marked as requiring confirmation in CLAUDE.md

**Reference:** Critical Rules #6 and #7 in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
