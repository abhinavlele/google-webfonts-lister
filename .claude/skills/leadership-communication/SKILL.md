# Leadership Communication

## Overview

Effective leadership communication balances **warmth** (trustworthiness, connection) and **competence** (capability, expertise). Most engineers over-index on competence and under-develop warmth signals.

## The Warmth + Competence Framework

| Quadrant | Perception | Fix |
|----------|------------|-----|
| High Warmth, High Competence | Admired, followed | Maintain balance |
| High Competence, Low Warmth | Respected but not trusted | Add connection cues |
| High Warmth, Low Competence | Liked but not respected | Demonstrate expertise |
| Low Both | Ignored | Start with warmth first |

**Key insight**: When in doubt, lead with warmth. Competence follows.

## Communication Scenarios

### 1. Difficult Feedback Conversations

**SBIR Framework** (Situation-Behavior-Impact-Request)

```markdown
Situation: "In yesterday's sprint planning..."
Behavior: "I noticed you interrupted Alex three times when she was explaining the architecture."
Impact: "This made it hard for the team to hear her perspective, and I saw her disengage for the rest of the meeting."
Request: "Going forward, I'd like you to let others finish before responding. Would a hand-raise system help?"
```

**Pre-conversation Checklist:**
- [ ] What specific behaviors (not traits) need to change?
- [ ] What's the impact on the team/project/person?
- [ ] What does success look like?
- [ ] What support can I offer?
- [ ] What's my opening line? (Write it out)

**Opening Lines for Difficult Conversations:**
- "I want to discuss something that's been on my mind. My goal is for us to work better together."
- "I have some feedback that might be uncomfortable, but I think it's important. Can we talk about it?"
- "I noticed something in our last interaction that I want to understand better."

**Managing Defensiveness:**
1. Pause—don't fill silence immediately
2. Acknowledge their perspective: "I hear that you see it differently."
3. Return to observable facts: "Help me understand what happened from your view."
4. Stay curious, not accusatory

### 2. Stakeholder Updates (Staff+ Visibility)

**Executive Summary Format:**
```markdown
**TL;DR:** [One sentence: what happened + what it means]

**Status:** 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Blocked

**Progress This Week:**
- Shipped X, which enables Y
- Resolved blocker on Z

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: [specific risk]
  Mitigation: [specific action]

**Decisions Needed:**
- [Decision] by [date] — [context]

**Next Week:**
- Focus: [primary goal]
```

**Writing for Executives:**
- Lead with the bottom line (they can ask for details)
- Quantify impact when possible
- Be explicit about what you need from them
- No more than 5 bullet points per section

### 3. 1:1 Preparation (Manager or Direct Report)

**With Your Manager:**
```markdown
## Updates (2 min)
- Shipped: [accomplishment]
- Blocked: [blocker + proposed solution]

## Discussion Topics (prioritized)
1. [Topic] — I want your input on [specific question]
2. [Topic] — Decision: should we X or Y?

## Career/Growth (if time)
- Visibility: I'd like to present at [forum] — can you sponsor?
- Skill gap: Working on [skill] — any resources you recommend?
```

**With Your Direct Reports:**
```markdown
## Check-in
- How are you doing? (Wait for real answer)
- Anything blocking you that I can help with?

## Their Agenda First
- What did you want to discuss today?

## My Topics (if time)
- Feedback: [specific observation]
- Heads up: [context they should know]

## Close
- What's your #1 priority this week?
- How can I help you succeed?
```

### 4. Navigating Office Politics (Introvert Strategies)

**Strategic Visibility Without Performing:**

| Leverage | Instead of |
|----------|------------|
| Written updates | Speaking up in large meetings |
| 1:1 relationship building | Large networking events |
| Deep expertise sharing | Broad shallow contributions |
| Pre-meeting alignment | Real-time debate |
| Async collaboration | Synchronous brainstorming |

**Political Intelligence Checklist:**
- [ ] Who has decision-making power? (Not always the title-holder)
- [ ] What does each stakeholder care about? (Their KPIs, fears, goals)
- [ ] Who influences whom?
- [ ] Where are the unspoken alliances and tensions?

**Building Alliances as an Introvert:**
1. **Coffee/walk 1:1s** (not group lunches)
2. **Helpful favors** — proactively solve problems for key people
3. **Remembering details** — follow up on things they mentioned
4. **Showing up consistently** — predictable reliability builds trust

### 5. Saying No (Without Burning Bridges)

**The Positive No Formula:**
1. **Yes** (to relationship/shared goal): "I really want to support this initiative..."
2. **No** (to specific request): "...and I can't take on the full project right now because of [commitment]."
3. **Yes** (to alternative): "Here's what I can do: [specific alternative]."

**Examples:**
- "I want to help the team succeed. I can't lead this initiative, but I could review the design or mentor the person who takes it on."
- "I appreciate you thinking of me. My bandwidth is committed to [X] through [date]. After that, let's revisit."

### 6. Running Effective Meetings

**For Introverts Who Lead:**

**Pre-meeting:**
- Send agenda 24h ahead with specific questions to discuss
- Assign pre-work (shifts processing to async)
- Identify who needs to speak and pre-wire their input

**During meeting:**
- "Before we continue, I want to hear from [name] on this."
- Use round-robins for important decisions
- Pause after questions (count to 5 silently)

**Post-meeting:**
- Send decisions + owners in writing within 2 hours
- Note who spoke vs. who didn't—follow up 1:1

## Warmth Cues to Practice

| Cue | How |
|-----|-----|
| Eye contact | 60-70% while listening |
| Nodding | Slow, deliberate nods |
| Leaning in | Slight forward lean |
| Open posture | Uncrossed arms, visible hands |
| Mirroring | Match energy/pace |
| Names | Use their name 2-3x per conversation |
| Gratitude | Specific thanks: "I appreciated when you..." |

## Competence Cues to Maintain

| Cue | How |
|-----|-----|
| Decisive language | "I recommend" not "I think maybe" |
| Structured thinking | "There are three considerations..." |
| Prepared responses | Anticipate questions, have data ready |
| Calm under pressure | Slow speech, lower pitch |
| Taking space | Don't rush, pause before answering |
