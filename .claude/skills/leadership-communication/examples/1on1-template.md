**Monthly:** Ask yourself these questions about each 1:1 relationship.

| Question | Green | Yellow | Red |

| Do they share bad news early? | Yes, immediately | Sometimes | I find out late |
| Do they push back on my ideas? | Healthy debate | Occasionally | Never |
| Am I learning about their life outside work? | Yes, naturally | Rarely | No |
| Do they seem energized or drained after our 1:1s? | Energized | Neutral | Drained |
